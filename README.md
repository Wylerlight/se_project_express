# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application using Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB.
It allows for creating, retrieving, and editing users, creating, editing, and deleting clothing items, and finally liking/unliking clothing items. There is also error handling that will issue specific response stauses based on unique errors.

To be created: API and user authentication

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing

Testing requests are run through Postman
